# PaperAge

Easy and secure paper backups of (smallish) secrets using the Age format ([age-encryption.org/v1](https://age-encryption.org/v1)).

## Features

* Takes plaintext input either from a file or stdin
* Encrypts that input with a passphrase
* Outputs a PDF with a QR code of the encrypted ciphertext
* The passphrase **isn't** rendered on the PDF so you can print it on an untrusted printer (for example at work or at the library)

## Limitations

* The maximum input size is about 1.5KiB as QR codes cannot encode arbitrarily large payloads (1.5KiB results in a payload of about 3KiB when encrypted)
* Only passphrase-based encryption is supported at the moment
* Only the A4 paper size is supported at the moment

## Usage

```
paper-age [OPTIONS] [INPUT]
```

### **Arguments:**

* `<INPUT>` — The path to the file to read, use `-` to read from stdin (max. ~1.5KB)

### **Options:**

* `--title <TITLE>` — Page title (max. 64 characters)

  Default value: `Paper Rage`
* `-o`, `--output <OUTPUT>` — Output file name

  Default value: `out.pdf`
* `-g`, `--grid` — Draw a grid pattern for debugging layout issues
* `--fonts-license` — Print out the license for the embedded fonts
* `-v, --verbose...` — More output per occurrence
* `-q, --quiet...` — Less output per occurrence
* `-h, --help` — Print help
* `-V, --version` — Print version

## Development

Run the latest from git locally, assuming you have already [installed Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started):

1. Pull this repo
2. Run the tests: `cargo test`
3. Get help: `cargo run -- -h`
4. Encrypt from stdin: `echo "Hello World" | cargo run -- --title="secrets from stdin" --out="stdin.pdf"`

### Releases

Releases are compiled and released on GitHub when new versions are tagged in git.

Use [cargo release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release) to tag and publish a new version, For example:

```sh
cargo release 1.2.3
```

⚠️ Append `--execute` to the command to actually execute the release.
